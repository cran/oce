}

\arguments{

  \item{file}{a connection or a character string giving the name of the file to load.  It is also
    possible to give \code{file} as a vector of filenames, to handle the case of 
    data split into files by a data logger.  In the multi-file case, \code{header} must be
    \code{FALSE}, \code{start} must be a vector of times, and \code{deltat} must be provided.}

  \item{basefile}{character string naming the base of filenames to load (used only by
    \code{read.adv.sontek.text}). The actual filenames are constructed by appending \code{".hd1"}
    and \code{".ts1"} to the base name.}

  \item{from}{index number of the first profile to be read, or the time of that profile, as created
    with \code{\link{as.POSIXct}} (hint: use \code{tz="UTC"}).  This argument is ignored if
    \code{header==FALSE}. See \dQuote{Examples}.}

  \item{haveAnalog1}{optional argument, only for Nortek devices: indicates whether to extract the
    ``analog1'' (8-bit) data.}

  \item{haveAnalog2}{optional argument, only for Nortek devices: indicates whether to extract the
    ``analog2'' (16-bit) data.}

  \item{to}{indication of the last profile to read, in a format matching that of \code{from}.  This
    is ignored if \code{header==FALSE}.}

  \item{by}{an indication of the stride length to use while walking through the file.    This is
    ignored if \code{header==FALSE}.  Otherwise, if this is an integer, then \code{by-1} profiles
    are skipped between each pair of profiles that is read. This may not make much sense, if the
    data are not equi-spaced in time.  If \code{by} is a string representing a time interval, in
    colon-separated format, then this interval is divided by the sampling interval, to get the
    stride length. \emph{BUG:} \code{by} only partially works; see the \dQuote{Bugs} section below.}
    
  \item{header}{a boolean indicating whether the file contains a header at the start.  (This will
    not be the case for files that are created by data loggers that chop the raw data up into a
    series of sub-files, e.g. once per hour.)}

  \item{latitude}{optional signed number indicating the latitude in degrees North.}

  \item{longitude}{optional signed number indicating the longitude in degrees East.}

  \item{start}{the time of the first sample, typically created with \code{\link{as.POSIXct}}.  This
    is mandatory if \code{header} is \code{FALSE}.  This may be a vector of times, if
    \code{filename} is a vector of file names.}

  \item{deltat}{the time between samples. (This is mandatory if \code{header=FALSE}.)}

  \item{originalCoordinate}{character string indicating coordinate system, one of \code{"beam"},
    \code{"xyz"}, \code{"enu"} or \code{"other"}.  (This is needed for the case of multiple files
    that were created by a data logger, because the header information is normally lost in such
    instances.)}

  \item{transformationMatrix}{transformation matrix to use in converting beam coordinates to xyz
    coordinates.  This will over-ride the matrix in the file header, if there is one.  An example is
    \code{rbind(c(2.710, -1.409, -1.299), c(0.071, 2.372, -2.442), c(0.344, 0.344, 0.344))}.}

  \item{type}{character string indicating type of file, and used by \code{read.adv} to dispatch to
    one of the speciality functions.}
  
  \item{tz}{character string indicating time zone to be assumed in the data.}
  
  \item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.  The value indicates the depth within the call stack
    to which debugging applies.  For example, \code{read.adv.nortek()} calls
    \code{read.header.nortek()}, so that \code{read.adv.nortek(...,debug=2)} provides information
    about not just the main body of the data file, but also the details of the header.}

  \item{monitor}{boolean, set to \code{TRUE} to provide an indication of every data burst read.}

  \item{processingLog}{if provided, the action item to be stored in the log.  This parameter is
    typically only provided for internal calls; the default that it provides is better for normal
    calls by a user.}

}

\details{Reads a binary-format ADV file.  This is straightforward for files with headers, since the
  headers contain all the information required for further processing.

  Files \emph{without} headers may be created in experiments in which a data logger was set up to
  monitor the serial data stream from an instrument.  The lack of header information places a burden
  on the user, who must supply such basic information as the times of observations, the instrument
  orientation, the instrument coordinate system, etc.  Example 3 below shows how to deal with such
  files.  Three things should be noted.

  \enumerate{

    \item The use must choose the appropriate \code{read.adv} variant corresponding to the
    instrument in question.  (This is necessary because \code{\link{oceMagic}}, which is used by the
    generic \code{\link{read.oce}} routine, cannot determine the type of instrument by examining a
    file that lacks a header.)

    \item The call to the \code{read} function must include a start time (\code{start}) and the
    number of seconds between data (\code{deltat}), again, because the instrument data stream may
    lack those things when the device is set to a serial mode.  Also, of course, it is necessary to
    set \code{header=FALSE} in the function call.

    \item Once the file has been read in, the user will be obliged to specify other information, for
    the object to be well-formed.  For example, the \code{read} function will have no way of knowing
    the instrument orientation, the coordinate system being used, the transformation matrix to go
    from \code{"beam"} to \code{"xyz"} coordinates, or the instrument heading, pitch, and roll, to
    go from \code{"xyz"} coordinates to \code{"enu"} coordinates.  Such things are illustrated in
    example 3 below.

  }

  In ADV data files, velocities are coded to signed 2-byte integers, with a
  scale factor being used to convert to velocity in metres per second.  These
  two facts control the maximum recordable velocity and the velocity
  resolution, values that may be retrieved for an ADV object name \code{d} with
  \code{d[["velocityMaximum"]]} and \code{d[["velocityResolution"]]}.
  
}

\section{Special considerations for NorTek files}{

    The data format is inferred from the System Integrator Guide [1].  This document lacks clarity
    in spots, and so \code{read.adv.nortek} contains some assumptions that are noted here, so that
    users will be aware of possible problems.

    A prominent example is the specification of the sampling rate, stored in
    \code{metadata$sampingRate} in the return value.  Repeated examination of the System Integrator
    Guide [1] failed to indicate where this value is stored in the various headers contained in
    Vector datasets.  After some experimentation with a few data files, \code{read.adv.nortek} was
    set up to calculate \code{metadata$samplingRate} as \code{512/AvgInterval} where
    \code{AvgInterval} is a part of the ``User Configuration'' header [1 p30], where the
    explanation is ``average interval in seconds'').  This formula was developed through trial and
    error, but it was confirmed later on the Nortek discussion group, and it should appear in
    upcoming versions of [1].

    Another basic issue is the determination of whether an instrument had recorded in continuous
    mode or burst mode.  One might infer that \code{TimCtrlReg} in the ``User Configuration'' header
    [1 p30] determines this, in bits 1 and 2.  However, this was the case in test files available to
    the author.  For this reason, \code{read.adv.nortek} infers the mode by reverse engineering of
    data files of known configuration.  The present version of \code{read.adv.nortek} determines the
    sampling mode from the ``\code{NRecords}'' item of the ``Vector Velocity Data'' header, which
    seems to be 0 for data collected continuously, and non-zero for data collected in bursts.  

    Taking these things together, we come upon the issue of how to infer sampling times for Nortek
    instruments.  There do not seem to be definitive documents on this, and so
    \code{read.adv.nortek} is based partly on information (of unknown quality) found on Nortek
    discusson boards.  The present version of \code{read.adv.nortek} infers the times of velocity
    observations differently, depending on whether the instrument was set to record in burst mode or
    continuous mode.  For burst mode, times stated in the burst headers are used, but for continous
    mode, times stated in the ``vector system data'' are used.  On the advice found on a Nortek
    discussion board, the burst-mode times are offset by 2 seconds to allow for the instrument
    warm-up period.  }

\section{Special considerations for Sontek files}{

  The binary format is inferred from Appendix 2.2.3 of the Sontek ADV operation Manual [3], with the
  following exceptions and notes.

  \enumerate{

    \item The documentation says sampling rate is in units of 0.1Hz, but a test file indicates that
    it is in 0.01 Hz.

    \item Bursts are recognized by byte sequences [2 p95].  In each case, a signalling byte is to be
    followed by a certain number of bytes, and so this code checks for two-byte sequences.  The are
    as follows:

    \itemize{
      \item \code{c(0x81,0x12)} for an ADV with no optional sensors
      installed.

      \item \code{c(0x83,0x18)} if a compass/tilt sensor is installed,
      but no temperature or pressure sensors.

      \item \code{c(0x85,0x16)} if temperature and/or pressure sensors
      are installed, but no compass/tilt sensor.

      \item \code{c(0x87,0x1c)} if a compass/tilt sensor is installed
      in addition to temperature and/or pressure sensors.

    }

    \strong{Bug:} only the second-last of these is handled in the present version of the package.
    
   } }

\value{An object of \code{\link[base]{class}} \code{"adv"}, which contains measurements made with an
  ADV device.  This is a list containing lists named \code{metadata}, \code{data}, and
  \code{processingLog}.  
  
  The \code{metadata} contains information as given in the following table.  The ``Nortek name'' is
  the name used in the Nortek System Integrator Guide [reference 1] and the ``Sontek name'' is the
  name used in the relevant Sontek documentation.  References are given in square brackets.

  \tabular{llll}{

  }

  The \code{data} list contains items with names corresponding to \code{adp} objects, with an
  exception for Nortek data.  Nortek instruments report some things at a time interval that is
  longer than the velocity sampling, and these are stored in \code{data} as \code{timeSlow},
  \code{headingSlow}, \code{pitchSlow}, \code{rollSlow}, and \code{temperatureSlow}; if burst
  sampling was used, there will also be items \code{recordsBurst} and \code{timeBurst}.

  The \code{processingLog} is in the standard format.
}

\section{Bugs}{The \code{by} argument only has an effect on quickly-varying variables, such as the
  fast timescale, velocity, backscatter, and amplitude  It has no effect on slowly-varying
  variables, such as heading, temperature, etc.  And, for the Nortek case, it also has no effect on
  the burst information.  The reason for all of this is that it is not altogether clear what
  \code{by} \emph{should} mean, for those variables.  Indeed, this is an argument for deleting
  \code{by} from the argument list, and this may be done in a future version of \code{read.adv}.}

    of ADV objects, and also outlines the other functions dealing with them.}
