The individual stations are available as \code{section$station[[1]]} through

This section is based on measurements made during October of 2003 in
Halifax Harbour by students in the \emph{Introduction to Physical Oceanography}
class at Dalhousie University.  The course was taught
Dan Kelley (the author of this package) and supervision at sea was
provided by teaching assistant Natacha Bernier, at the time a PhD student at
Dalhousie. Note the alteration of two station locations, to correct errors in
transcribing field notes (e.g. a hand-written \code{8} was evidently typed as
\code{3}).

The stations cover a 14 km region running from station 308, near the Sackville
River, seaward to station 315, at the entrance to the general Harbour, offshore of
the lovely Point Pleasant Park.
