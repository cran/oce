\title{Find the Type of an Oceanographic Data File}
\usage{
oceMagic(file, debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a connection or a character string giving the name of the file
to be checked.}

\item{debug}{an integer, set non-zero to turn on debugging.  Higher values
indicate more debugging.}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the file type, or \code{"unknown"}, if
the type cannot be determined. If the result contains \code{"/"} characters,
these separate a list describing the file type, with the first element being
the general type, the second element being the manufacturer, and the third
element being the manufacturer's name for the instrument. For example,
\code{"adp/nortek/aquadopp"} indicates a acoustic-doppler profiler made by
NorTek, of the model type called AquaDopp.
}
\description{
This function tries to infer the file type, based on either the data within
the file or, more rarely, based on the file name.
