\title{Trim a landsat Image to a Geographical Region}
\usage{
landsatTrim(x, ll, ur, box, debug = getOption("oceDebug"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{landsat} object, e.g. as read by \code{\link{read.landsat}}.}

\item{ll}{A list containing \code{longitude} and \code{latitude}, for the
lower-left corner of the portion of the image to retain.}

\item{ur}{A list containing \code{longitude} and \code{latitude}, for the
upper-right corner of the portion of the image to retain.}

\item{box}{A list containing \code{x} and \code{y} (each of length 2),
corresponding to the values for \code{ll} and \code{ur}, such as would
be produced by a call to \code{locator(2)}.}

\item{debug}{A flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a moderate
amount of debugging information, or a higher value for more debugging.

return An object of \code{\link[base]{class}} \code{"landsat"}, with data having
been trimmed approximately as specified.}

\description{
Trim a landsat image to a latitude-longitude box. This is only an approximate
operation, because landsat images are provided in x-y coordinates, not
longitude-latitude coordinates.
}
\details{
As of June 25, 2015, the matrices storing the image data are trimmed to indices
determined by linear interpolation based on the location of the \code{ll} and
\code{ur} corners within the lon-lat corners specified in the image data. (A
previous version trimmed in UTM space, and in fact this may be done in future
also, if a problem in lonlat/utm conversion is resolved.) An error results if
there is no intersection between the trimming box and the image box.
