\usage{
read.met(
  file,
  type = NULL,
  skip = NULL,
  encoding = "latin1",
  tz = getOption("oceTz"),
  debug = getOption("oceDebug")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a character string naming a file that holds met data.}

\item{type}{if \code{NULL}, which is the default, then an attempt is
made to infer the type from the file contents. If this fails, it
will be necessary for the user to provide a value for the \code{type}
argument.  The permitted choices are: (a) \code{"csv"} or \code{"csv1"} for an
old CSV format no longer provided as of October 2019,
(b) \code{"csv2"} for a CSV format noticed on the Environment Canada
website in October 2019 (but note that the paired metadata file
is ignored), (c) \code{"csv3"} for a CSV format noticed on the
Environment Canada website in January 2020,
and (d) \code{"xml2"} for an XML format that was noticed
on the Environment Canada website in October 2019.}

\item{skip}{integer giving the number of header lines that precede the
data.  This is ignored unless \code{type} is \code{"csv"} or \code{"csv1"}, in which case
a non-\code{NULL} value of \code{skip} is taken as the number of lines preceding
the columnar data. Specifying \code{skip} is usually only needed if \code{\link[=read.met]{read.met()}}
cannot find a line starting with \code{"Date/Time"} (or a similar string).}

\item{encoding}{a character value that indicates the encoding to be used for
this data file, if it is textual.  The default value for most functions is
\code{"latin1"}, which seems to be suitable for files containing text written in
English and French.}

\item{tz}{timezone assumed for time data.  This defaults to
\code{getOption("oceTz")}, which is very likely to be wrong.  In
a scientific context, where UTC is typically used for oceanographic
measurement, it makes sense to set \code{tz="UTC"}.  Note that these
data files do not contain timezone information, instead giving
data in Local Standard Time (LST).  Since LST differs from city
to city, users must make corrections to the time, as
shown in the \dQuote{Examples}, which use data for
Halifax Nova Scotia, where LST is UTC-4.}

\item{debug}{a flag that turns on debugging.  Set to 1 to get a moderate
amount of debugging information, or to 2 to get more.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{met} object.
}
\description{
Reads some meteorological file formats used by the Environment Canada (see
reference 1).  Since the agency does not publish the data formats, this
function has to be adjusted every few years, when a user finds that the
format has changed. \strong{Caution:} as of March 2022, this function fails on some
on Windows machines, for reasons that seem to be related to the handling of
both file encoding and system encoding. Adjusting the \code{encoding} parameter
of this function might help.  If not, try reading the data with
\code{\link[=read.csv]{read.csv()}} and then using \code{\link[=as.met]{as.met()}} to create a \linkS4class{met} object.
