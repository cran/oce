\title{Salinity from electrical conductivity, temperature and pressure}

\description{Compute salinity based on electrical conductivity, temperature, and pressure.}

\usage{swSCTp(conductivity, temperature=NULL, pressure=0,
       conductivityUnit=c("ratio", "mS/cm", "S/m"),
       eos=getOption("oceEOS", default="gsw"))}

\arguments{
  \item{conductivity}{conductivity ratio, or a CTD object. If a CTD object,
      then the next 3 arguments are ignored, since the information can be
      gleaned from the object.}
  \item{temperature}{\emph{in-situ} temperature [\eqn{^\circ}{deg}C]}
  \item{pressure}{pressure [dbar]}
  \item{conductivityUnit}{string indicating the unit used for conductivity;
      \code{ratio} means actual conductivity divided by standard conductivity
      (4.2914 S/m).}
  \item{eos}{equation of state, either \code{"unesco"} or \code{"gsw"}.}
}

\details{Calculate salinity from what is actually measured by a CTD,
    \emph{i.e.} conductivity, \emph{in-situ} temperature and pressure.  Often
    this is done by the CTD processing software, but sometimes it is helpful to
    do this directly, \emph{e.g.}  when there is a concern about mismatches in
    sensor response times.  If \code{eos="unesco"} then salinity is calculated
    using the UNESCO algorithm described by Fofonoff and Millard (1983); if it
    is \code{"gsw"} then the Gibbs-SeaWater formulation is used, via
    \code{\link{gsw_SP_from_C}}.}

\value{Practical salinity.}
